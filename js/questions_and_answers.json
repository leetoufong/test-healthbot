		"Question": "What is a Pandemic ?",
		"Answer": "A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease. Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people sustainably. Because there is little to no pre-existing immunity against the new virus, it spreads worldwide.\\n\\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is infecting people and spreading easily from person-to-person. On March 11, the COVID-19 outbreak was [characterized as a pandemic by the WHO](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020).\\n\\nThis is the first pandemic known to be caused by a new coronavirus. In the past century, there have been four pandemics caused by the emergence of new influenza viruses. As a result, most research and guidance around pandemics is specific to influenza, but the same premises can be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemics of respiratory disease follow a certain progression outlined in a \"[Pandemic Intervals Framework](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/intervals-framework.html).\" Pandemics begin with an investigation phase, followed by recognition, initiation, and acceleration phases. The peak of illnesses occurs at the end of the acceleration phase, which is followed by a deceleration phase, during which there is a decrease in illnesses. Different countries can be in different phases of the pandemic at any point in time and different parts of the same country can also be in different phases of a pandemic.",

		"Question": "Are children more at-risk?",
		"Answer": "Information about [COVID-19 in children](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html) is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that children with confirmed COVID-19 generally had mild symptoms. Person-to-person spread from or to children, as among adults, is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.  Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.\\nHowever, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. People who have serious chronic medical conditions are believed to be at higher risk. Despite lower risk of serious illness among most children, children with COVID-19-like symptoms should avoid contact with others who might be at higher risk, such as [older adults and adults with serious chronic medical conditions](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html).",

		"Question": "When is someone infectious?",
		"Answer": "The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. There are reports of asymptomatic infections (detection of virus with no development of symptoms) and pre-symptomatic infections (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2, but their role in transmission is not yet known. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2–14 days.",

		"Question": "Why do the number of cases for previous days increase?",
		"Answer": "Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase. (Sometimes this effect is described as “backfill.”) State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC. Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.",

		"Question": "What is the source of the virus?",
		"Answer": "COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with [MERS-CoV](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html) and [SARS-CoV](//www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html), and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the [Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html#emergence).",

		"Question": "How does the virus spread?",
		"Answer": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).\\n\\nCOVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in [many affected geographic areas](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html). Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.\\n\\nLearn what is known about the [spread of newly emerged coronaviruses](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html).",

The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.

Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.",

		"Answer": "In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.",

Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. However, children do get the virus and become ill. Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.\\n\\nIf your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.\\n\\nDiscourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.",

		"Question": "While school’s out, can my child hang out with their friends?",
		"Answer": "*   The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.\\n*   To help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends.\\n*   Make sure children practice [everyday preventive behaviors](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html), such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk.\\n    *   Revise spring break plans if they included non-essential travel.\\n*   Information about [COVID-19 in children](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html) is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may have only mild symptoms.

		"Answer": "*   **Stay in touch with your child’s school.**\\n    *   Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers.\\n    *   Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know.\\n*   **Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible.**\\n    *   Have consistent bedtimes, and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday.\\n    *   Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity.\\n    *   Allow flexibility in the schedule—it’s okay to adapt based on your day.\\n*   **Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group.**\\n    *   The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school.\\n    *   Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person.\\n*   **Look for ways to make learning fun.**\\n    *   Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things.\\n    *   Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks.\\n    *   Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact.\\n    *   Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience.\\n    *   Use audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events.",

Follow CDC’s guidance on “[What to do if you are sick](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsteps-when-sick.html).”\\n*   **Watch for signs of stress in your child.**\\n    *   Some common changes to watch for include excessive worry or sadness, unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, and difficulty with attention and concentration. For more information, see the “For Parents” section on CDC’s website, [Manage Anxiety and Stress](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html).\\n    *   Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and [share facts](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/share-facts.html) about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand.\\n    *   Go to CDC’s [Helping Children Cope with Emergencies](//www.cdc.gov/childrenindisasters/helping-children-cope.html) or [Talking with Children About COVID-19](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/talking-with-children.html) for more information.\\n*   **Teach and reinforce [everyday preventive actions](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)****.**\\n    *   Parents and caretakers play an important role in teaching children to wash their hands. Explain that hand washing can keep them healthy and stop the virus from spreading to others.\\n    *   Be a good role model—if you wash your hands often, they’re more likely to do the same.\\n    *   Make [handwashing a family activity](//www.cdc.gov/handwashing/handwashing-family.html).\\n*   **Help your child stay active.**\\n    *   Encourage your child to play outdoors—it’s great for physical and mental health. Take a walk with your child or go on a bike ride.\\n    *   Use indoor activity breaks (stretch breaks, dance breaks) throughout the day to help your child stay healthy and focused.\\n*   **Help your child stay socially connected.**\\n    *   Reach out to friends and family via phone or video chats.\\n    *   Write cards or letters to family members they may not be able to visit.\\n    *   Some schools and non-profits, such as the [Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning](https://casel.org/) and [The Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence](http://ei.yale.edu/), have resources for social and emotional learning. Check to see if your school has tips and guidelines to help support social and emotional needs of your child.",

		"Answer": "CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available. These actions are part of [everyday preventive actions](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.\\n\\n*   When washing hands, you can use plain soap or antibacterial soap. Plain soap is as effective as antibacterial soap at removing germs.\\n*   If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an FDA-approved alcohol-based [hand sanitizer](//www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html) that contains at least 60% alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol by looking at the product label.\\n\\nCDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer [products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredients](https://www.fda.gov/media/136118/download) and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product. Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the [World Health Organization guidance](https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Guide_to_Local_Production.pdf). Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.\\n\\n*   To be effective against killing some types of germs, [hand sanitizers](//www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html) need to have a strength of at least 60% alcohol and be used when hands are not visibly dirty or greasy.\\n*   Do not rely on “Do It Yourself” or “DIY” recipes based solely on essential oils or formulated without correct compounding practices.\\n*   Do not use hand sanitizer to disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects.

Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your household’s daily routine.\\n\\n*   **Continue practicing everyday preventive actions.** Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.\\n*   **Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes.** Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with [COVID-19 symptoms](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html), or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily. [Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.](//www.cdc.govhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)\\n*   **Stay in touch with others by phone or email.** If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends, especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions.",

		"Question": "Am I at risk if I touch someone who died of COVID-19 after they have passed away?",
		"Answer": "COVID-19 is a new disease and **we are still learning how it spreads.** The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.\\n\\nIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\\n\\nPeople should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).\\n\\nCleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time). [Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-03/documents/sars-cov-2-list_03-03-2020.pdf) are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform [hand hygiene](//www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html) by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.",

If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of State’s Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. In addition, the [US embassy](https://www.usembassy.gov/) closest to or in the country where the U.S. citizen died can provide assistance.",

If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food.

If not available, provide them with a tissue or some other way to cover their coughs and sneezes.\\n    *   Do not use of public transportation, shared rides, and taxis to transport the sick person home.\\n    *   Contact emergency services for those who need emergency care, when needed, and let them know about the person’s symptoms.\\n*   Contact local public health officials and communicate with staff, members, and volunteers about possible exposure to the virus.\\n    *   Read [preventing the spread of COVID-19 if someone is sick](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html) to learn more.\\n*   Local health officials can offer guidance for closing the facility or restricting access. An initial short-term closure may be recommended to allow time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation.\\n    *   Implement flexible telework and sick-leave policies for staff, if possible, and provide instructions about how and when to safely return to work.\\n    *   Consider the need to cancel in-person group activities in other locations. Instead use phone and online (live or recorded) meeting and service options.\\n    *   Work with local public health officials to decide when it is safe to re-open the facility and your programs and services.",

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Association of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI): [ANSI/AAMI PB70:2012](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf) describes the liquid barrier performance and a classification of surgical and isolation gowns for use in health care facilities.\\n*   As with any type of PPE, the key to proper selection and use of protective clothing is to understand the hazards and the risk of exposure. Some of the factors important to assessing the risk of exposure in health facilities include source, modes of transmission, pressures and types of contact, and duration and type of tasks to be performed by the user of the PPE. ([Technical Information Report (TIR) 11](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/TIR110511preview.pdf) \\[[AAMI 2005](//www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/protectiveclothing/#references)\\]).\\n*   For gowns, it is important to have sufficient overlap of the fabric so that it wraps around the body to cover the back (ensuring that if the wearer squats or sits down, the gown still protects the back area of the body).",

		"Answer": "*   An N95 FFR is a type of respirator which removes particles from the air that are breathed through it. These respirators filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles. N95 FFRs are capable of filtering out all types of particles, including bacteria and viruses.",

		"Question": "What makes N95 respirators different from facemasks (sometimes called a surgical mask)?",
		"Answer": "*   [Infographic: Understanding the difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators](//www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandDifferenceInfographic-508.pdf)\\n*   N95 respirators reduce the wearer’s exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets. N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.\\n*   Not everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able to wear a respirator safely.\\n*   Achieving an adequate seal to the face is essential. United States regulations require that workers undergo an annual fit test and conduct a user seal check each time the respirator is used. Workers must pass a fit test to confirm a proper seal before using a respirator in the workplace.\\n*   When properly fitted and worn, minimal leakage occurs around edges of the respirator when the user inhales. This means almost all of the air is directed through the filter media.\\n*   Unlike NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales.\\n*   The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes.  Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated.",

		"Question": "What is a Surgical N95 respirator and who needs to wear it?",
		"Answer": "*   A surgical N95 (also referred as a medical respirator) is recommended only for use by healthcare personnel (HCP) who need protection from both airborne and fluid hazards (e.g., splashes, sprays). These respirators are not used or needed outside of healthcare settings. In times of shortage, only HCP who are working in a sterile field or who may be exposed to high velocity splashes, sprays, or splatters of blood or body fluids should wear these respirators, such as in operative or procedural settings. Most HCP caring for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients should not need to use surgical N95 respirators and can use standard N95 respirators.\\n*   If a surgical N95 is not available for use in operative or procedural settings, then an unvalved N95 respirator may be used with a faceshield to help block high velocity streams of blood and body fluids.",

		"Question": "My employees complain that Surgical N95 respirators are hot and uncomfortable – what can I do?",
		"Answer": "*   The requirements for surgical N95 respirators that make them resistant to high velocity streams of body fluids and help protect the sterile field can result in a design that has a higher breathing resistance (makes it more difficult to breath) than a typical N95 respirator. Also, surgical N95 respirators are designed without exhalation valves which are sometimes perceived as warmer inside the mask than typical N95 respirators. If you are receiving complaints, you may consider having employees who are not doing surgery, not working in a sterile field, or not potentially exposed to high velocity streams of body fluids wear a standard N95 with an exhalation valve.",

		"Question": "My N95 respirator has an exhalation valve, is that okay?",
		"Answer": "*   An N95 respirator with an exhalation valve does provide the same level of protection to the wearer as one that does not have a valve. The presence of an exhalation valve reduces exhalation resistance, which makes it easier to breathe (exhale). Some users feel that a respirator with an exhalation valve keeps the face cooler and reduces moisture build up inside the facepiece. However, respirators with exhalation valves should not be used in situations where a sterile field must be maintained (e.g., during an invasive procedure in an operating or procedure room) because the exhalation valve allows unfiltered exhaled air to escape into the sterile field.",

The required labeling of [NIOSH-Approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators](//www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/N95-Infographic-Mask-Labeling-508.pdf)  includes the NIOSH name, the approval number, filter designations, lot number, and model number to be printed on the respirator. You can verify that your respirator approvals are valid by checking the [NIOSH Certified Equipment List (CEL)](//www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/cel/default.html).",

		"Question": "What do I do with an expired respirator?",
		"Answer": "*   In times of increased demand and decreased supply, consideration can be made to use N95 respirators past their intended shelf life. However, the potential exists that the respirator will not perform to the requirements for which it was certified. Over time, components such as the strap and nose bridge may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Prior to use of N95 respirators, the HCP should inspect the respirator and perform a seal check. Additionally, expired respirators may potentially no longer meet the certification requirements set by NIOSH.

		"Question": "What steps should I take to prepare my facility?",
		"Answer": "Because of close contact and the number of people in correctional and detention facilities (including prisons and jails), staff and people who are incarcerated are at greater risk for the spread of germs. To help your facility prepare for the possible spread of [COVID-19](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html), update your emergency operations plan. This includes:\\n\\n*   Adding key [COVID-19 prevention strategies](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html) and posting information in the facility on how to limit the spread of germs.\\n*   Reminding staff to stay home when sick.\\n*   Identifying points of contact for local public health agencies.\\n*   Identifying physical locations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) where you can medically isolate incarcerated persons, as well as where to quarantine known close contacts of people with COVID-19.\\n    *   Follow guidance on medical [isolation](#Isolation) and [quarantine](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html#QuarantiningCloseContacts%20).\\n    *   Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be separate.\\n*   Offering flu shots to staff and people who are incarcerated, because limiting cases of flu can help speed the identification of people with COVID-19.\\n*   Developing ways to continue providing critical services, such as mental health support.\\n*   Ensuring adequate stocks of hygiene, cleaning, and medical supplies.\\n    *   _Hygiene:_ Soap (preferably liquid to promote use), tissues, and hand drying supplies, as well as hand sanitizers, when possible. Ensure no-cost access to soap.\\n    *   _Cleaning:_ [EPA-registered disinfectants](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2) effective against the virus that causes COVID-19\\n    *   _Medical supplies_: Supplies for daily clinic needs, [personal protective equipment (PPE)](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html), and testing\\n*   Creating and testing communications plans to share critical information.\\n*   Setting up systems to safely transfer people between facilities and identifying alternative strategies to in-person court appearances, when possible.\\n    *   Prevent [confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html#ConfirmedvsSuspected%20) from being transferred between jurisdictions and facilities unless necessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding.\\n*   Planning for staff absenteeism.\\n\\nFollow [CDC guidance](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html) on recommended PPE for staff who will have direct contact with an individual with possible COVID-19 infection, or infectious materials. Make contingency plans for the likely event of [PPE shortages](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html#recommended-ppe).\\n\\nFollow the [CDC Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html) and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates for staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. When no on-site healthcare capacity is available, make a plan for how to ensure that people suspected to have COVID-19 will be medically isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided medical care.

		"Question": "What steps do I need to take to implement quarantine in my facility?",
		"Answer": "Close contacts of a sick person (who have been within about 6 feet of the sick person or have had direct contact with infectious droplets, such as from a cough or squeeze) should be placed under quarantine for 14 days to determine if they develop symptoms. CDC has developed [guidance](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/guidance-evaluating-pui.html) on quarantining close contacts of people with COVID-19. Be sure to monitor symptoms twice a day and move anyone developing symptoms to medical isolation right away, after ensuring that they are wearing a face mask. Individuals under quarantine should stay within the quarantine space, including when eating their meals, using the bathroom, and receiving medical evaluation. Laundry of people in quarantine can be washed with the laundry of others. Individuals handling laundry should wear recommended [PPE](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html#recommended-ppe), should not shake the laundry, and should clean their hands often.\\n\\nIdeally, people under quarantine due to contact with a COVID-19 case should be housed individually. If separate spaces in a facility are not available, refer to CDC’s full guidance document for correctional and detention centers for other [options](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html#management). [People at high risk for complications of COVID-19](//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) (older adults, people with severe underlying chronic medical conditions) should not be housed with other quarantined people if at all possible. Facilities without enough space or without onsite healthcare capacity should coordinate with local public health officials.\\n\\nIndividuals in quarantine can be released from quarantine back to their previous housing arrangement in the facility if they have not developed symptoms during the 14-day time period.",

		"Answer": "The CDC continues to [recommend](//www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/hand-hygiene/index.html) the use of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) as the primary method for hand hygiene in most clinical situations[1](#r1). ABHR effectively reduces the number of pathogens that may be present on the hands of healthcare personnel after brief interactions with patients or the care environment. In addition, frequent use of ABHR formulated with emollients is less damaging to the skin than frequent hand washing. This factor, along with ease of use and greater access, leads to greater overall compliance with use of ABHR than hand washing with soap and water.  Hands should be washed for at least 20 seconds with soap and water when visibly soiled, before eating, and after using the restroom.",

This policy remains in effect through April 30, 2020. Formulations included in the FDA guidance are consistent with [World Health Organization production guidance](https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Guide_to_Local_Production.pdf?ua=1). These locally produced products are intended for routine healthcare personnel hand cleaning, must not contain active ingredients other than those specified in the FDA guidance, and should not take the place of other regulated skin antiseptics (e.g. surgical hand rub). To avoid contamination with spore-forming organisms, WHO formulations require a 72-hour post-production quarantine. Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.",
